This project was made in Visual studio using the ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) template and was coded using the .NET 7.0 Framework.

The goal of this project was to create a appointment management system using MVC and host it using a cloud based service. 

The project was originally hosted using Microsoft Azure which hosted both the project and the mysql database it was connected to.

Currently this project is no longer being hosted using Azure so in order to view it functionality first hand you would have to setup your own mysql database.

If you choose to set up your own test envirorment you can go through the LocalSetupGuide.docx which will walk you through how to setup the project to run locally.

If you wish to see a breif overview demonstrating most of the applications functionality and test scripts that were used to test some of the functionality you can view
